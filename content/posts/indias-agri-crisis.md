**Note:** This post may be hard to follow/incoherent if you haven't heard the
podcast episode embedded in the next paragraph.

A colleague and I were recently talking about the state of politics in India.
To set some context, he in general tended towards a laissez-faire approach
while I preferred a protectionist model. When the discussion turned to the
[2020 Farmers' protest], he introduced me to [The Seen and the Unseen] podcast
\- [Ep. 140: India's agricultural crisis]

I found this podcast highly informative and have subscribed to it despite
several philosophical differences with it. That said, here are some of my
issues with the material presented.

The case for a regulatory body
------------------------------

**What was presented:** [Bt Cotton] was a primary plot point for the first part
of the episode. The protagonists were the outlaw farmers who used Bt Cotton and
were the only ones who managed to survive a bollworm-induced crop-failure. They
also used this as proof that farmers aren't as unenterprising as the \"urban
elite\" would like to believe. Current issues include approving HT-Bt Cotton
and Monsanto pulling its application for new seed varities because of the
regulatory overreach and price-fixing.

**What I agreed with:**

-   It is hard to defend the government asking the farmers to destroy the GMO
    crops which had already been cultivated. Regulatory bodies seem to be
    moving too slowly.
-   GMO foods are completely scientific and safe - the anti-GMO movement is a
    little cuckoo.

**What I feel was missing:**

1.  There are lobbies on both sides - and it is hard to say which is more
    insidious. [Mahyco] who make Bt Cotton was/is? a subsidiary of [Monsanto] -
    a company with deep pockets, which was even more deeply mired in
    controversies. So much so that their new owners (Bayer) ended up dropping
    the name to avoid disrepute.
2.  Apprehension towards GM-crops isn't specific to India and till date
    Bt-Cotton isn't permitted in Hawaii, USA. From my quick reading online, it
    appears that while Bt Cotton was successful in turning around the fate of
    cotton farming in India, it isn't without its issues - there seem to be a
    surge of GM-tolerant strains of pests - requiring constantly reintroducing
    newer generations of genetically modified seeds. While this might seem
    analogous to the pesticide-tolerance issue that farmers already face, there
    is a further complication I outline in the next point.
3.  Monsanto enforces vendor lock-in. GMO seeds are considered patented
    technology. Farmers cannot save the seeds from previous yields - they need
    to pay royalties to Monsanto for each yield. And they are willing to sue
    farmers who inadvertently get Monsanto's genes into their crops because of
    cross-pollination. Deregulation of all GMOs is in essence turning over the
    reigns to multinational conglomerates.

The Precautionary Principle
---------------------------

In my opinion, this was the weakest segment of the show.

The host claims that the humanitarian cost of applying the precautionary
principle is too high in agriculture and so it should be done away with. This
is defensible, but debatable. My challenge to this would be that we often
underestimate the intensity of a misstep until it is too late - Nassim Taleb's
*The Black Swan* brings up this challenge too - Not a single person would have
received an award for reinforcing air-pilot's cabins that made 9/11 impossible
to pull off since it wouldn't have happened. So the person who did do that
would retire one day thinking they achieved nothing remarkable. However, the
person who pitches the idea post-hoc and helps clean up the mess receives a lot
of plaudits. People who apply the precautionary principle often go unrewarded
for all the calamities avoided - precisely because they achieved what they set
out to achieve.

However, one of the guests (Barun Mitra?) seems to lose the plot.

-   The principle is a fundamental challenge to human civilization in the last
    2000 years and a reversal of everything we know.
-   The principle states that unless you are 100% sure the technology is fine,
    you shouldn't go ahead with it.
-   In the name of science, the principle destroys the fundamental premise of
    science because science works on uncertainty
-   It shouldn't even be called a principle - because *(and I rewound to
    ensure I am not misquoting here because it is that terrible as an
    analogy!)* applying the precautionary principle, every human should be in
    prison till they can prove they are innocent.

This is an absolute strawman. There are degrees to which the precautionary
principle can be applied. One can need a well defined approval process - the
fact that there is lack of transparency in the government is an issue that
needs to be addressed regardless of deregulation.

Furthermore, while GMOs have proven to be safe over the last 30 years, the
issue here is that they take a class of items and extend it to an individual
item. Take for instance the same stance and apply it to medicine and you will
see why it is terrible to do away with the precautionary principle - *\"Modern
Medicine has worked for the last 300 years. So we should not apply the
precautionary principle to new formulations and pre-approve all medication\".*

While GMOs are not bad, individual mutants should be tested extensively before
widespread use. The approval process in India might be slow. But take a
hypothetical GMO that while being resistant to a particular pest also kills
certain endemic species or results in the land becoming unarable. I was shocked
at the callousness with which the speaker called for completely doing away with
the precautionary principle.

Land-ownership restrictions
---------------------------

**What I agreed with:** Farmers who want to exit agriculture shouldn't be
given a hard time. I couldn't find much material on farmers not allowed to go
landless - though if that is true, I support the rights of farmers to move to
other fields.

**What I felt was missing in the discussion:**

The authors implied that the inability to sell farm-land was the reason India
wasn't going through an manufacturing revolution. However, a [recent report
from McKinsey] indicates that the 3 key areas of improvement for our
manufacturing sector are

1.  *labor (and capital) productivity* which are 4 to 30 times lower than other
    nations in several sectors
2.  *securing know-how and technology -* less-developed sectors don't have the
    tech to really grow
3.  *availability of capital -* in terms of FDI

[recent report from McKinsey]: https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/advanced-electronics/our-insights/a-new-growth-formula-for-manufacturing-in-india

Unavailability of land for factories isn't even mentioned in this list and I
don't think that is a mistake. Despite the high levels of population, there is
an abundance of land available for setting up industries in India. The
industrialists prefer that they are set up in agricultural basins - likely
because of availability of established water-ways and cheap labor in terms of
ex-farmers. However, this study does not square with the claim that inability
to sell farmland stifles a manufacturing boom.

Furthermore the claim that agricultural land can be sold for 40-100x (I don't
remember the exact number mentioned by the speakers) is confined to a small
number of farmers living close to urban sprawls - which, again, is not going to
facilitate the manufacturing industry since most of this will be reassigned to
IT parks and upscale housing.

Schrodinger's farmer
---------------------

Another issue that I found spread throughout the episode was fluctuating
power-levels of the farming class. On the one hand, they are portrayed as being
smart enough to use GMO crops which aren't directly approved. However, they
also seem to be easy enough to dupe when the sugar mills hold back pay for
several years and then pay them a fraction of what is owed to them. To me - and
this is entirely a subjective interpretation of what truly happens on the
ground - this sounds like they are conflating two classes of farmers

1.  The rich, sophisticated farmers who are hassled by the protections offered
    by the government - ones who are able to reach out to Monsanto and its
    subsidiaries and smuggle in seeds.
2.  The poor, under-educated farmers who labor on tiny strips of land, growing
    one or a few crops and are taken advantage of by private entities (like
    sugar mills) despite government protections.

The guests actually do state this to some effect when they suggest that the
government is holding back entrepreneurial farmers who would otherwise be able
to buy unlimited stretches of land to grow. This is definitely true - every
program is going to stifle those who are several standard-deviations better
than the average - schools syllabus is another such example. That is by no
means just cause to the protections/boundaries in place.
