# About

I work as a senior engineer in [NVIDIA]'s CPU team in Bangalore. I am exploring
test generation techniques for large scale mesh interconnects. I previously
worked on performance validation of CPU cores. I have also worked on writing
fuzzers for binary rewriters and ARM architecture validation. I am proficient
in C, Aarch64 assembly, Python, and am generally good at picking up new tools
and languages. I run the [Rust] language meetup in NVIDIA.

I previously worked in [IBM Research] under the prestigious BlueScholar
programme and contributed to several prototypes, a [paper] and a [patent] in AI
planning, service delivery automation, natural language processing, and. I have
also worked on [characterizing synchronization techniques] as my master's
thesis in [IIT Madras]

I am a proud father and since 2019 my life has revolved around being the best
dad I can be.
